# ImageSharingWithCloudService
C# (MVC) Image sharing web application for large-scale enterprise computing. Hosted App and Web Services on Azure Cloud.

This application is in C# MVC framework and backed by NoSQL. In the beginning, I build it to support Azure cloud SQL database too.
I have used Azure Table Storage and Blob storage to store the data.

Created and deployed Web Services on Azure cloud.
